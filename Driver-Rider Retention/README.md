This project explores the driver and rider retention relationship using a set of 50,000 operational data collected by Ultimate Inc.

The scope involves data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, experimental and metrics design, predictive modeling, and final discussion.


Final discussion on how to improve retention rate:

The best predictors are duration, city, ultimate_black_user and trips_in_first_30_days.

This means Ultimate can focus on these features and see how they can improve them in order to improve its long term user retention. Let's break it down to each individual feature on how each one can be improved.

• For duration, Ultimate can provide incentives for users to stay active, such as discount and loyalty rewards.

• For city, as shown in exploratory analysis previously, it seems that users in King's Landing tend to stay active, while users in Astapor and Winterfell tend to become inactive. Ultimate can pay more attention and focus its marketing and sales in these two cities.

• For ultimate_black_user, it seems that more users become inactive when they didn't take the ultimate black in the first 30 days. Perhaps special offers for new users for the ultimate black would help.

• For trips_in_first_30_days, discount offers for new users can help so they would take more trips initially.
